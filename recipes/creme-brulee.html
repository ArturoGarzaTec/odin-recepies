    <h2 class="second-title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="normal-text">
      <li>2 cups of heavy or light cream, or HALF&HALF</li>
      <li>
        1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, or 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
      </li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>5 egg yolks</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="second-title">Steps</h2>

      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 162Â°C. In a saucepan, combine the cream, split
        vanilla bean, and salt; heat on low until warm. Let it sit for a few
        minutes, then discard the vanilla bean. (If using vanilla extract, add
        it now).
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, mix the egg yolks and sugar until smooth. Add about a quarter
        of the cream to this mixture, then pour the sugar and egg mixture into
        the cream and stir. Pour into four 6-ounce molds and place them in a
        baking dish; fill the dish with boiling water halfway up the sides of
        the molds. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the centers are just set.
        Cool completely. Refrigerate for several hours and up to a couple of
        days.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to serve, cover each custard with about a teaspoon of sugar
        in a thin layer. Place the molds under a broiler 2 to 3 inches from the
        heat source. Turn on the broiler. Cook until the sugar melts and browns
        or even slightly chars, approximately 5 minutes. Serve in two hours.
