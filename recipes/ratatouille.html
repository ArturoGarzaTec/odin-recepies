      <li>1 teaspoon of minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley</li>

      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>Pepper to taste</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 190˚C.</li>
      <li>
        Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately
        1/16-inch (1 mm) rounds, then set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the sauce: heat olive oil in a 12-inch (30 cm) oven-safe skillet
        over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, garlic, and peppers until soft,
        about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed
        tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from
        heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the
        sauce with a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the sliced vegetables in alternating patterns (e.g., eggplant,
        tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce from the outer edge to the
        center of the skillet. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the herb seasoning: in a small bowl, mix basil, garlic, parsley,
        thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Pour the herb seasoning over the
        vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet with aluminum foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover,
        then bake for an additional 20 minutes until the vegetables soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve while hot as a main dish or side. Ratatouille is also excellent
        the next day: cover with aluminum foil and reheat in an oven at 350˚F
        (180˚C) for 15 minutes, or simply in the microwave to the desired
        temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>
